1.0.1
------
- Changed the output format of attributes of class type Time so that it complies with Solr's date field type.  The output format is now %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.  e.g. 2001-06-11T00:00:00Z

1.0.0
------
- Major refactoring was done to modularize search.  This should minimize the code that needs to be changed in the model if the modeling framework is to be switched.  The search code is more generalized to accommodate Rails 3 attribute access that isn't specific to Mongo Mapper.
- Added support for indexing :many associations.  This implementation is specific to Mongo Mapper but can be easily modified if the modeling framework is swapped.  

0.1.4
------
- Added a way to specify the Solr document id (uniqueKey) field that the MongoMapper document _id key maps to.
- Added handling for Solr document id/uniqueKey field that's set as multiValued so that the first value is chosen.  There can only be one value for the id/uniqueKey field but it's still possible to set the field as multiValued.  RSolr returns an array containing only one value for the id/uniqueKey field when the field is multiValued.

0.1.3
------
- Added an option named "solr_field_name" for MongoMapper document keys.  The value of "solr_field_name" overrides the name of the key when indexing the document in Solr.


0.1.2
______
- Added the ability to define the value of the "qt" request parameter as an option in the options hash of the search method.  The value of the "qt" request parameter defaults to "standard" if one is not specified in the options hash.
